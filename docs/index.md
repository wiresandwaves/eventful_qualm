# Eventful Qualm

This site tracks the architecture and decisions for the Eventful Qualm project.

- Scope: Automate two characters in isolated Win11 VMs on a single Windows host using only keyboard/mouse + UI/logs.
- Goals: Smooth manual override, human-like input, modular design (ports & adapters), strong tests.
- Tech: Python 3.13, hexagonal architecture, typed configs, structured logs.

See the ADRs for why certain choices were made and Design for diagrams and flows.
